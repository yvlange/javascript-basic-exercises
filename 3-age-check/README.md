# Exercise 3: Age Check

Write a program that:

1. Greets the user for entering your site
2. Ask your user for their name
3. Ask your user for their year of birth. If they don't type anything, set a default value to `2021`.
4. Calculate their age and store it in a variable.
5. If age is lower than 10, show the user a the message: `"You are too young for this <user name>. Come back when you are older.`
6. If age is greater than 10 and lower than 18, ask them to confirm that they are next to an adult.

   1. If they are with an adult, show them:`"Welcome to my super website <user name>. Good, that you are not alone here!"`
   1. Otherwise: `"You are too young for this <user name>. You need an adult next to you to continue."`

7. If age is equal or greater than 18, then show: `"Welcome to my super website <user name>"`
8. If the visitor age is exactly equal to your age, then show: `"Welcome to my super website <user-name>. We are the same age!"`
