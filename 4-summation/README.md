# Exercise 4: Summation

Write a program that asks the user for a number, and calculates the summation from 0 to the given number, and then show a message to the user with the calculated value.

## Requirements

- If the number is negative, finish saying that the number given was negative and that you can't calculate the sumatory for that
- Assume numbers given are integers (without decimals)
- Use a `for` loop

## Example

- Input given by the user: 10
- Summation: 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 = 55
